This project runs the famous rock, paper, scissors game.
It tracks users input and compares it against the computers random choice to determine a winner.
It also logs the points and scores of both the user and computer and tallys it after each completed round.
Using basic DOM manipulation and CSS styling the game includes a simple user interface that allows them to make their choice by selecting an onscreen button.
